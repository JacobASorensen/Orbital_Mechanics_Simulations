# Orbital Mechanics Simulations
## Project Purpose
### I want to better understand n-body dynamics for n > 2
Specifically I am interested in learning more about Lagrange points, and how satellites will behave in the different types of lagrange points.
I also want to see what types of maneuevers are required to enter and stay within a lagrange point. (How are there asteroids in Earth-Sun L4 and L5?)
### I want to learn and subsequently improve my ability to interface C++ with Python
The simulation code is written in C++, and the main interface is written in python.
Before now I hadn't done anything like this.
ChatGPT is an instrumental learning tool when it comes to completely new territory like this; I.e. writing a python library in C++, and figuring out how to do that in a timely manner as part of a side project for a class.
The n-body ODE python code is mine, a lot of the other stuff is scavenged. 
(The runge-kutta python was provided by my professor, and it came from a textbook)

### I want to see what sort of information I can glean
Specifically I want to try to simulate a grid of different starting positions within lagrange points, and see where the most stable position is
